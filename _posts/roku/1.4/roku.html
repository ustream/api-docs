                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The IBM Cloud Video Player SDK lets you play IBM Cloud Video live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the SDK gives you full control over the embedded Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.</p>
                    <p>This document describes the basic steps to make a Roku app using the Player SDK.</p>

                    <h2>Before you begin</h2>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>Account prerequisites</h3>
                    <p>Before going into details, please note that document assumes the following:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <h2>Step 1: Explore the SDK package</h2>
                    <p>Your package contains two subfolders under <strong class="break-word">roku/src/main/brightscript/tv/ustream/roku</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>api</strong>: this folder contains the SDK itself</li>
                        <li><strong>sampleapplication</strong>: this folder contains a sample application showcasing the use of the SDK</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 2: Add the SDK to your application</h2>
                    <p>Copy the <strong>api</strong> folder of the SDK package into your application. Make sure your application has its own <code>Main()</code> function.</p>
                    <p class="note">The <code>Main()</code> function of the <strong>sampleapplication</strong> folder can be found in the <strong>UstreamSampleApplication.brs</strong> file.</p>
                </section>
                
                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 3: Register your app at IBM Cloud Video</h2>
                    <p>The SDK requires the use of a <em>IBM Cloud Video API key</em>, which is validated whenever the SDK communicates with IBM Cloud Video streaming servers. The sample application contains a sample API key which you can use for testing. The sample API key can only be used to play content on the test channel(s) also used in the sample app.</p>
                    <p>Before you can start using the Player SDK for playing content from your own channel(s), you will need to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>get a valid <strong>IBM Cloud Video API key</strong> owned by the IBM Cloud Video user that owns the content you would like to play</li>
                        <li>register the <strong>application identifier(s)</strong> - of every app in which you will integrate the Player SDK in - at IBM Cloud Video</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">The application identifier is typically structured as <em>com.your_company.your_project</em>.</p>

                    <p>Before you can create and use an instance of the player you have to configure the lib with your <strong>IBM Cloud Video API key</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace <strong>your_api_key</strong> to your actual <strong>IBM Cloud Video API key</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Replace <strong>your_application_bundle</strong> to your actual application identifier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre><code>Function Main()
    init(“<strong>your_api_key</strong>”,”<strong>your_application_bundle</strong>”)
end Function</code></pre>
                </section>

                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 4: Play live or recorded content</h2>
                    <p>You can intiate playback of live or recorded content using the <code>playChannel</code> or <code>playRecorded</code> method.</p>
                    <p>Starting playback of a IBM Cloud Video channel:</p>
                    <pre><code>Function Main()
    init(“<strong>your_api_key</strong>”,”<strong>your_application_bundle</strong>”)
    playChannel("<strong>channel_id</strong>")
end Function</code></pre>
                    <p>Starting playback of a IBM Cloud Video recorded video:</p>
                    <pre><code>Function Main()
    init(“<strong>your_api_key</strong>”,”<strong>your_application_bundle</strong>”)
    playRecorded("<strong>video_id</strong>")
end Function</code></pre>

                    <p class="note">The <code>playChannel</code> and <code>playRecorded</code> methods need to be called using String parameters, even though content IDs are typically numbers. For example: <code>playChannel("11378037")</code></p>
                </section>

                
                
                
                <section>
                    <h2>Step 5: Handle Player callbacks</h2>
                    <p>IBM Cloud Video content owners can protect their content using various "locks" that implement password protection, age restriction and other limitations. Streaming servers reject clients connecting for playback if lock conditions are not met. The SDK calls the appropriate callback function to indicate this to the application.</p>
   
                    
                    
                    <h3>Generic callbacks</h3>

    
                    <h4>Non-interactive locks</h4>
                    <p>The following callbacks notify the app that playback has stopped due to a server-side "reject", and lets the app act on the reason of the reject.</p>
                    <table class="table responsive">
                        <thead>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>Sample code is located for each of these callbacks in the <strong>Utils.brs</strong> file of the <strong>sampleapplication</strong> folder.</p>

                    
                    <h4>Other errors</h4>
                    <p>The following callbacks are designed to notify the app about playback issues that are not related to content restriction.</p>
                    <table class="table responsive">
                        <thead>

                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr><td><strong>requestFailed()</strong></td><td>Communication has failed between the SDK and IBM Cloud Video servers.</td><td>error code as Int</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>channelOffline()</strong></td><td>The channel to be played is currently off-air, there is no live broadcast taking place.</td><td>error code as Int</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>recordedVideoNonExist()</strong></td><td>The recorded video to be played can not be found. It may have been deleted.</td><td>error code as Int</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>privateVideo()</strong></td><td>The recorded video to be played is not available because it has been made private by the owner.</td><td>error code as Int</td></tr>
                            <tr><td><strong>formatNotSupported()</strong></td><td>The recorded video to be played is not available in a format that is compatible with Roku.</td><td>error code as Int</td></tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>Sample code is located for each of these callbacks in the <strong>Utils.brs</strong> file of the <strong>sampleapplication</strong> folder.</p>

    
                    
                    <h3>Interactive callbacks</h3>
                    <p>The following locks notify the app that playback has stopped due to a server-side reject, and needs to pass information from a user input when reconnecting.</p>
                    <table class="table responsive">
                        <thead>
