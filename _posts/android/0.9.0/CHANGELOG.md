# Changelog
## [0.9.5] - 2017-08-25
### Changed
- Updated media player
- Faster track switching in general (fewer rebuffers when changing subtitle tracks for example)
- Reduced playback gap on Surface change

## [0.9.3] - 2017-07-24
### Changed
- Correctly display CEA-608 type closed caption names. In some previous versions this displayed a generated name instead of the desired one.
- When opening a *RECORDED* content `ContentNotPlayable` is no longer reported if the requested content is not available immediately only after our servers prepare the content.
- When connected to a *LIVE* content that is Offline at the moment, `ContentNotPlayable` is not reported right away when the channel goes online. 
We wait for the content to be available in the requested format. (This only affected the first viewer of the broadcast, 
because the server might need time to prepare a supported format.)

## [0.9.2] - 2017-07-20
### Changed
- MetaData class' `mediaDate` field's value is now always in UTC timezone. Previously it was PST for *RECORDED* and UTC for *LIVE*.
- In a scenario when the client is connected to an offline channel (the SDK is in the `WaitingForContent` state) and the channel goes live.
    The `mediaDate` is now updated with the new value.
- Disabled eCDN support for now.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-07-04
### Added
- Support for multiple players on the same Activity. In order for this to work the API had to be changed.
    More specifically, the creation of the player changed from `PlayerView.getUstreamPlayer()` to a Factory based implementation:
    ```java
    private final UstreamPlayerFactory ustreamPlayerFactory = new UstreamPlayerFactory(USTREAM_PLAYER_SDK_KEY, context);
    // Where playerId is the identifier of our player. Must be persisted in order to retrieve the same instance 
    // in case of a configuration change.
    // IUstreamPlayer interface is changed to UstreamPlayerAndroid.
    UstreamPlayerAndroid ustreamPlayer = ustreamPlayerFactory.createUstreamPlayer(playerId);
    if (!ustreamPlayer.isInitialized()) {
        ustreamPlayer.initWithContent(contentDescriptor);
    }
    ...
    ```
    The `playerView` must be set along with the listeners.
    This enables the player to be initialized (and to be buffered) without a view to render on.
    This can come in handy when implementing a news feed like application, where the content is in a `RecyclerView`.
    It can reduce the time your users need to wait in order to see the video.
    ```java
    ...
    ustreamPlayer.setPlayerListener(listener);
    ustreamPlayer.setErrorListener(errorListener);
    ...
    ustreamPlayer.setPlayerView(playerView);
    ustreamPlayer.attach();
    ```
    For further information, see the documentation.
- Support for eCDN.

### Changed
- Various bugfixes include:
    - Inconsistent player init when a process is restarted from `savedInstanceState` by the Android framework.
      After a process restart the player is no longer implicitly initialized.
      Calling `ustreamPlayer.isInitialized()` will return `false`, and the player needs to be initialized manually.
    - No more crash if the Activity's context is `ContextThemeWrapper`.
    - No more crash on certain devices on Android 4.2 with Qualcomm 800 SoCs, where the renderer reported negative video size.

## [0.7.0] - 2017-05-15
### Changed
- Joda-Time dependency has been removed from the sample application (was added in [0.5.0])

## [0.6.0] - 2017-04-19
### Added
- Track selection API:
    - Ability to manage subtitles, audio, video tracks
    - Ability to select specific video formats (resolution, bitrate)
	- Track selection example in the sample application
	- Default subtitles are selected and displayed by default

## [0.5.1] - 2017-03-01
### Changed
- Sample application dependencies changed: Joda-Time added.
- Player SDK deployment moved from local Maven repo to AAR file. We are switching to the simple AAR file deploy until
a proper artifact repository is available.
- Bug fixes and stability improvements

### Removed
- Removed Joda-Time dependency from the user facing interface for greater flexibility. Though Joda-Time is still used
inside the Player SDK for now, therefore it must be included as a dependency.

## [0.4.0] - 2016-05-31
### Added
- Added `IUstreamPlayer.isInitialized()` method to check whether the player is already initialized. This is most useful
on a configuration change event. The information representing the init state of the player does not need to be manually
saved anymore.

### Changed
- Tweaks around `IUstreamPlayer.destroy()`. This is not bound to Android lifecycle anymore, can be called anywhere
after initialization.
- Bugfixes and stability improvements
